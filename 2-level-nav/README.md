# Boarding Pass

We work at an intersection between human needs and technical requirements.  We use design and development to negotiate a resolution between the separate, often opposing priorities of people, organizations, and machines. This challenge will test your ability to evaluate a complex problem, use design principles to generate a solution, and development skills to execute your solution.

In /assets you will find an image of a poorly-designed boarding pass from Delta Airlines (boarding-pass.jpg).  The boarding pass is perfectly adequate as a machine-readable inventory tracking tag, but it is ineffective as a human-readable resource.  While all the necessary information a person would need is present, it is scattered across the pass without clear visual organization or hierarchy, making it difficult for a person to use.  


## The Challenge

1. **Redesign the boarding pass using only CSS and HTML**
2. **Account for the technical requirements of the airline**
   - Showcase the [airline's brand](https://news.delta.com/delta-air-lines-logos-brand-guidelines), but do not let it overwhelm the actionable content.
   - Bar codes must be included for passenger check-in/tracking.
   - The passenger's identity must be clearly displayed for manual verification.

3. **Account for the human needs of the traveler who will use the boarding pass.**
   - Rank-order the information presented on the boarding pass by importance to a traveler and reflect this hierarchy in your design.
   - The design should accommodate different display formats: smartphone and print.
   - Navigating an airport can be a stressful experience, see if there is some way you can make the design cheerful or calming without jeopardizing its clarity.
